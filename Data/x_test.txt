If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would have been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he took the time to do that his father would become impatient, and there was the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his father's hand any moment.
It was making Gregor quite confused.
When he had nearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing, he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come.
It was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it actually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of something to eat.
Through the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had been lit in the living room.
It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was put out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had stayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as they went away together on tip-toe.
They had even got used to it, both Gregor and the family, they took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it, although there was no longer much warm affection given in return.
That was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind in his present state, pressed upright against the door and listening.
He would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink but scratching at the leather for hours on end.
It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she entered the room.
Was this man, probably younger than he was, lecturing him like a schoolmaster?
And was he to learn nothing about the reasons for his arrest or those who were arresting him?
He finally came again to a halt in front of the supervisor's desk.
"I fear I may have caused you some exceptional work today."
"No, it can't happen again," she agreed, and smiled at K. in a way that was almost pained.
You have been arrested, but it's not in the same way as when they arrest a thief.
Before going out the door he asked, "Is Miss Bürstner home?"
"No!" the father cried so that the answer was pushed against the question.
He steadied himself by touching the ceiling lightly with one hand.
"That's why you betrayed him all these years."
"Do you imagine I didn’t cry over him?"
"The moment you thought that you had succeeded in pulling him down, you decided to get married!"
Georg gazed at the terrible sight of his father.
"Why did he have to go so far away!"
"But look at me!" the father cried.
Georg stood, almost absent-minded, near the bed.
"And so that you could satisfy yourself with her undisturbed, you defiled your mother's memory."
He lay there, quietly smoking a cigar, until about eleven o'clock.
He wasn't able to hold out longer than that, and went a little way into the hallway as if in that way he could make Miss Bürstner arrive sooner.
It was already gone half past eleven when someone could be heard in the stairway.
“You’re probably surprised to find us so inhospitable,” said one of the men.
K. approached the woman sitting in the armchair with a baby at her breast.
“Who are you?” asked K.
“I’m from the castle,” she replied dismissively.
K. was marched out of the house by two men and into the snow.
“Where do you want to go?” asked one of the men.
“This is the way to the castle, that’s the way to the village,” he said.
K. was left alone in the snow again, feeling disinclined to move.
“There won’t be any sleighs coming this way,” said a man from a nearby cottage.
“This is the road to the castle,” K. objected, but the man only shrugged.
"On an exceptionally hot evening early in July, a young man came out of the garret in which he lodged and walked slowly, as though in hesitation, towards K. bridge."
"He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase."
His garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more like a cupboard than a room.
"The landlady who provided him with garret, dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below."
Every time he passed her kitchen, the door stood open, and each time he passed, the young man had a sick, frightened feeling.
He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady and was afraid of meeting her.
"This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but for some time past, he had been in an overstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria."
He had become so completely absorbed in himself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting anyone at all.
"He was crushed by poverty, but the anxieties of his position had ceased to weigh upon him."
"He had given up attending to practical matters."
Nothing that any landlady could do had real terror for him.
"To be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her gossip and demands for payment was unbearable."
Rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen.
"This evening, however, he became acutely aware of his fears."
He thought, 'I want to attempt a thing like that and am frightened by these trifles.'
"Yes, all is in a man’s hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice. Taking a new step, uttering a new word is what they fear most."
I chatter because I do nothing. I’ve learned to chatter this last month, lying for days together in my den.
"Why am I going there now? Am I capable of that? Is that serious?"
"It is not serious at all. It’s simply a fantasy to amuse myself."
The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle and the stench all around worked painfully on his nerves.
“I do not care,” I continued. “Also, do you know that it is not safe for us to take walks together? Often I have a feeling that I should like to strike you."
“I care not whether it be wise or stupid,” I cried in return.
Fired by this mishap, I pulled out all the money left to me, staked it all on the same venture, and — again lost!
“At last! Zero!” screamed the old lady as she turned to me in a whirl of triumph.
“My money, my winnings, give them to me,” she cried with feverish impatience.
“But the rules do not allow of more than 120 gulden being staked upon zero at a time.”
“Oh no! Why so? I believe you,” she said.
“You will see me arise from the dead.”
At this moment she looked at me in a peculiar way.
“Stake upon zero again!” the Grandmother ordered.
At last the ball dropped into one of the notches.
“Zero!” cried the croupier.
She had allowed me to fire up without correcting me.
However, she had promised to give me an explanation that night.
Then I rose from the table, feeling as though I were stupefied.
“Zero has come up three times in one dozen rounds!” I exclaimed.
“Well, absurd though it be, I place great hopes on your playing of roulette,” she remarked musingly.
“In my opinion, no good comes of gambling.”
My losses had seemed insignificant at first, but they grew in a rush.
“I have no money for gambling,” I replied quietly.
I figured rapidly back in my mind. It was three days ago that Harvey had won two hundred francs from me shaking poker dice in the New York Bar.
“No money. Money hasn’t come,” he paused. “I tell you it’s strange, Jake. When I’m like this I just want to be alone. I want to stay in my own room. I’m like a cat.”
“Oh, nobody reads him now,” Harvey said, “except the people that used to read the Alexander Hamilton Institute.”
Internally he had been moulded by the two women who had trained him. He had a nice, boyish sort of cheerfulness that had never been trained out of him, and I probably have not brought it out. He loved to win at tennis. He probably loved to win as much as Lenglen, for instance. On the other hand, he was not angry at being beaten.
“Oh, yes. He’s got children, and he’s got money, and he’s got a rich mother, and he’s written a book, and nobody will publish my stuff; nobody at all. It isn’t bad, either. And I haven’t got any money at all. I could have had alimony, but I got the divorce the quickest way.”
“No. Just don’t let him know I talked to you. I know what he wants.” Now for the first time she dropped her bright, terribly cheerful manner. “He wants to go back to New York alone, and be there when his book comes out so when a lot of little chickens like it. That’s what he wants.”
“No. Just don’t let him know I talked to you. I know what he wants.” Now for the first time she dropped her bright, terribly cheerful manner. “He wants to go back to New York alone, and be there when his book comes out so when a lot of little chickens like it. That’s what he wants.”
Bill Gorton arrived, put up a couple of days at the flat and went off to Vienna. He was very cheerful and said the States were wonderful. New York was wonderful.
“Might remember a little,” Bill said. “Remember something about a prize-fight. Enormous Vienna prize-fight. Had a nigger in it. Remember the nigger perfectly.”
“You’re right. Wasn’t me at all. Was another fellow. Think we called him the local Harvard man. Remember him now. Studying music.” “How’d you come out?”
Manuel was facing the bull again, the muleta held low and to the left. The bull’s head was down as he watched the muleta.
“No, he’s not,” said Zurito. Manuel stood up and, the muleta in his left hand, the sword in his right, acknowledged the applause from the dark plaza.
Didn’t they know enough to keep back? Did they want to catch the bull’s eye with the capes after he was fixed and ready? He had enough to worry about without that kind of thing.
He did not have to think about them. He just did the right thing. His eyes noted things and his body performed the necessary measures without thought.
There was a shock, and he felt himself go up in the air. He pushed on the sword as he went up and over, and it flew out of his hand. He hit the ground and the bull was on him. Manuel, lying on the ground, kicked at the bull’s muzzle with his slippered feet.
“That was nice, bright boy,” Max said. “You’re a regular little gentleman.”
“Bright boy can do everything,” Max said. “He can cook and everything. You’d make some girl a nice wife, bright boy.”
He came out from the kitchen. The cut-off barrels of the shotgun made a slight bulge under the waist of his too tight-fitting overcoat. He straightened his coat with his gloved hands.
Nick opened the door and went into the room. Ole Andreson was lying on the bed with all his clothes on. He had been a heavyweight prizefighter and he was too long for the bed. 
“They put us out in the kitchen,” Nick went on. “They were going to shoot you when you came in to supper.”
Everybody was drunk. The whole battery was drunk going along the road in the dark.
We were going to the Champagne. The lieutenant kept riding his horse out into the fields.
It is dangerous. It will be observed.
The second matador slipped and the bull caught him through the belly.
The bull rammed him wham against the wall, and he lay in the sand.
He got up like crazy drunk and tried to slug the men carrying him away.
The kid had to kill five bulls because you can’t have more than three matadors.
He tried five times, and the crowd was quiet because it was a good bull.
Finally, he sat down in the sand and puked while the crowd hollered.
Minarets stuck up in the rain out of Adrianople across the mud flats.
Jim Gilmore came to Hortons Bay from Canada.
Jim was short and dark with big mustaches and big hands.
Liz Coates worked for Smith’s.
Liz liked Jim very much.
Liz had good legs and always wore clean gingham aprons.
The blacksmith shop was painted red and faced the school.
There was the general store and post office with a high false front.
The houses were in a big grove of elm trees and the road was very sandy.
It was very beautiful in the spring and summer, the bay blue and bright.
Liz found that she liked the way Jim's hair was black on his arms.
For the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to pen, I neither expect nor solicit belief.
Mad indeed would I be to expect it in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence.
Yet mad am I not—and very surely do I not dream.
But tomorrow I die, and today I would unburden my soul.
My immediate purpose is to place before the world plainly, succinctly, and without comment, a series of mere household events.
In their consequences these events have terrified—have tortured—have destroyed me.
From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my disposition.
My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make me the jest of my companions.
I was especially fond of animals, and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets.
I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not uncongenial with my own.
I was sick—sick unto death with that long agony; and when they at length unbound me, I felt that my senses were leaving me.
"The sentence—the dread sentence of death—was the last of distinct accentuation which reached my ears."
"Yet for a while, I saw—but with how terrible an exaggeration!"
I saw the lips of the black-robed judges; they appeared to me white, whiter than the sheet.
I saw that the decrees of what to me was Fate were still issuing from those lips.
"I shuddered because no sound succeeded."
"I saw, too, for a few moments of delirious horror, the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable draperies."
Then my vision fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table.
"They wore the aspect of charity, and seemed white slender angels who would save me."
"All at once, there came a most deadly nausea over my spirit."
In that chamber was I born.
You deny it?—let us not argue the matter.
There is, however, a remembrance of aerial forms—of spiritual and meaning eyes.
But it is mere idleness to say that I had not lived before.
Ah! vividly is her image before me now.
The realities of the world affected me as visions.
My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make me the jest of my companions.
There came thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the horrors of Toledo.
A fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart.
I saw, too, for a few moments of delirious horror, the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable draperies.
Hear the sledges with the bells—Silver bells!
What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, in the icy air of night!
While the stars that oversprinkle all the heavens seem to twinkle.
With a crystalline delight.
"I offer this book of truths, not in its character of truth-teller, but for the beauty that abounds in its truth."
"It is with humility that I pen the opening sentence of this work."
I shall speak of the physical, metaphysical, and mathematical universe.
In the original unity of the first thing lies the secondary cause of all things.
"In illustration of this idea, I propose to take a survey of the universe."
Mrs. Ferrars died on the night of the 16th–17th September.
I was sent for at eight o’clock on the morning of Friday the 17th.
Mrs. Ferrars' husband died just over a year ago.
“You’ve only got to look at her,” I have heard my sister say.
The symptoms of gastritis and arsenical poisoning are not unlike.
I stood hesitating in the hall, with all this passing through my mind.
“What on earth are you doing out there, James?”
I walked into the dining room and gave Caroline a peck on the cheek.
“A sad business,” I said, continuing with my breakfast.
“She must have died in her sleep,” I added thoughtfully.
The intense interest aroused in the public by what was known as “The Styles Case” has now somewhat subsided.
John Cavendish invited me to Styles to spend my leave.
Mrs. Cavendish had married again, to everyone's surprise.
Styles Court had been Mrs. Cavendish's home since her first marriage.
The weather was fine as we drove up to the house.
“Evie’s not young and beautiful, but she’s as game as they come.”
“I can tell you, Hastings, it’s making life jolly difficult for us.”
"The village of Styles St. Mary was quiet, a marked contrast to the chaos of war."
"John Cavendish had married two years ago and settled at Styles."
"Mrs. Cavendish was a lady who expected others to fall in line with her plans."
The intense interest aroused in the public by what was known as “The Big Four” has now somewhat subsided.
I landed in France two days before, and was now en route for London.
“Mon ami, Hastings!” he cried. “Mon ami!”
Poirot stood facing me, a small valise in his hand.
“Yes,” he said, “I am going to South America.”
“It is droll, is it not?”
Hercule Poirot’s methods were his own.
“Order and method,” he always said, “and the little grey cells.”
“But when are you going?”
“In an hour’s time,” Poirot replied.
“I believe that a well-known anecdote exists to the effect that a young writer, determined to make the commencement of his story forcible and original enough to catch and rivet the attention of the most blasé of editors, penned the following sentence.”
Jumping up from her seat, she let down the window and stuck her head out.
The Calais express was singularly empty.
“Dear me, we’ve shocked the kind gentleman!” she observed to an imaginary audience.
I found myself evincing an increasing interest in her.
We passed through Amiens. The name awakened many memories.
I share rooms with a very interesting man. He’s a Belgian ex-detective.
I told her about the Styles Case, and she listened spellbound.
My goodness gracious me, where’s my powder-puff?
It was five minutes past nine when I entered our joint sitting-room for breakfast.
